#Introduction
This is a programme to navigate a drone safely through the city.
The drone will be able to take both basic and complex inputs.

My take on this challenge was to create the drone as a constructor.

Every new Drone() created will have the ability to:

    -Turn Left
    -Turn Right
    -Move Forwards
    -Move Backwards
    -Travel North
    -Travel South
    -Travel East
    -Travel West

The drone also has the ability to information such as:

    -What direction it is facing
    -Current coordinates
    -Coordinate history.

#Instructions
Download from github
CD into folder and npm install.

To input both basic and complex files into the drone, simple type npm start or node index.js into the CLI. <- Need to fix this!!!!

# Testing
